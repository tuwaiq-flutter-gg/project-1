# Library Project

Delivery Conditions:

* Build the App using Dart Programming Langauge
* Upload it to Github

Mandatory ideas to consider in your code:
1.Import `Dart:io` to take input from the console.

2.Make sure to comment on your code for documentation purposes and readability.

3.Divide you program into sections to orgnize your progam.

4.Create at least one `Loop`.

5.Use `if-statment` and `Switch`.

6.Apply Opject Oranated Programming `OOP` concept.

7.Use `String Interpolation` expressions.

8.Include B`racket Notation` to access a property of an object.

9.Use the `Static` keyword.

10.You must use `Abstract Classes` in your App.

11.Use conventions naming for variables, classes, and functions.

Potential ideas to consider in advancing your code:

1.Use `Getter and setter` methods to manipulate the data of the class fields.

2.implement inhertaince using `with` keyword.

3.Use `late`, `const` and `final` keywords in your code.

Project Requirements:

### Part one 

1.The App shoud be able to `add`, `edit`, `delete`, and `view information` of the book.

2.To add a new book, each one should have `book_id`, `book_title`, `author`, `price`, and `quantity`.

### Part Two

3.The ability to search for any book in your library either with `book_id`, `title`, or `author`.

### Part Three

4.Selling one or many books and issuing an invoice for the process.

5.Before confirming the selling process you need to check if there is enough `quantity` from the book in the warehouse if so, the `quantity` value should be updated. if not, print "Sorry! we are out of stock".
